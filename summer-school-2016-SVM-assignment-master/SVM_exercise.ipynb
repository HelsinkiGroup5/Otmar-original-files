    "During class, you have learned about Support Vector Machines (SVMs). In this assignment, you will experiment with several aspects pertaining their training, in a multi-class classification task. We will work with static hand gestures data. To do so, we are gonna extract, from a dataset of real hand-gestures images, *HOG features*, and use these features to train *multi-class* SVM models. You can learn more about HOG features [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_of_oriented_gradients) and [here](https://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/triggs/pubs/Dalal-cvpr05.pdf).\n",

    "So far, you have computed performance on a single test-train split, a method also know as *hold-out*. However, best practice in Machine Learning is to report performances in a *k-fold cross-validation* fashion. To do so, you start by producing `k` different sets of training data (often called batches). These can be easily created via the class [sklearn.cross_validation.StratifiedKFold](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cross_validation.StratifiedKFold.html) available form [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). Then, at each iteration we repeat the holdout method: each time, one of the `k` batches is used as the test set, and the other `k−1` batches are put together to form a training set. Then the average accuracy, precision and recall across all `k` trials is computed. Your task is to implement k-fold cross-validation, and report the model accuracy, precision and recall.\n",
